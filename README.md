# REST SHOP

This repository is archived and moved to GitLab. For more information go to https://gitlab.sintef.no/energy/shop/restshop

REST SHOP is a REST API for the hydropower scheduling model SHOP developed by SINTEF. The API is built on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). Hosting of the server with uvicorn/hypercorn or docker is explained below, for other hosting options please visit the [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/). REST SHOP can also be hosted on [Windows server with IIS](#hosting-with-iis).

> WARNING: REST SHOP does not implement secure communication and should never be exposed on the internet.

## Start REST SHOP server with uvicorn on Windows

REST SHOP requires pyshop. Please visit the [pyshop GitHub repo](https://github.com/sintef-energy/pyshop) for installation guidelines.

Make sure [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) is installed. Clone this repository and navigate to root with Command Prompt or PowerShell. Make sure all requirements are installed in Python with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start the server, run the following commnad with uvicorn
```
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```
or hypercorn
```
hypercorn main:app --bind 127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Run tests

Make sure test requirements are installed:
```
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

Run all tests:
```
pytest
```

## Build dockerimage

The restshop image requires SHOP binary files. Put the required files specified in [readme.txt](https://github.com/sintef-energy/restshop/blob/main/binaries/readme.txt) in the binaries folder.

Navigate to the root of this repository and run

```
docker build -t restshop .
```

## Start restshop server

```
docker run --rm --name restshop -p 8000:8000 restshop
```

## Check the swagger documentation

Open your favorite browser and visit

http://localhost:8000/docs

## Run the basic example

This step requires you to have a python environment with the following packages

- requests
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

Then run the basic example at the root of this repo.

```
python basic.py
```

## Debugging

Each SHOP session is running a separate instance of SHOP. By setting the "log_file" attribute when creating sessions, SHOP generates a python-log that enables recreating a workflow. The log file is saved inside the docker container, but can be copied to the current of your local file system using the following command:
```
docker cp {container id}:/root/restshop/{logfile} .
```

Running docker container can be listed with the command:
```
docker ps
```

## Export image

Docker images can be compressed and exported for external users using the following command where the .tar.gz is a compressed image file and restshop is the name of the image to export:
```
docker image save -o restshop.tar.gz restshop
```

## Hosting with IIS

The Rest API can be hosted on Windows IIS using AspNetCoreModule. Configuration is available in the [web.config](https://github.com/sintef-energy/restshop/blob/main/web.config) file. Follow these steps to host on IIS:
1. Checkout this repo to the folder you want to host if from, for example the server wwwroot. This folder will hereby be referred to as the restshop folder.
2. Install the version of python that corresponds to the SHOP version you are using.
3. Setup python virtual environment and install dependencies. Navigate to the restshop folder in Command Prompt or PowerShell and run
```
python -m venv venv
```
This will create a virtual environment in the venv subfolder of restshop. Activate by running
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
and install packages by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Setup IIS
Create a new application pool with "No Managed Code" and might as well require "LocalSystem" identity to have the righte priveleges to execute python. Add a new website with physical path to the restshop folder and the newly create application pool. Browse to the newly created website and verify that the site is running. In case of problems, check the log files in the logs subfolder and the windows Event Viewer.

## Poetry
This repo uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage external dependencies. [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/sintef-energy/restshop/blob/main/pyproject.toml) contains all dependencies and versions for development and deployment. Poetry resolves dependencies based on pyproject.toml and stores the resolved dependencies in [poetry.lock](https://github.com/sintef-energy/restshop/blob/main/poetry.lock). To update the corresponding requirements files, execute

```
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements-test.txt --dev --without-hashes
```
